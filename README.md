I'm Emlyn, a physicist and multi-hat technologist interested in quantum, AI and nuclear (among other things). I like playing with data, and simulating physics problems with code. I enjoy working in Python, Julia and R, and begrudgingly use C++, Matlab and Mathematica.

- 🔭 I’m working on my personal website, which has been very fun and quite confusing at the same time!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more R, and dipping my toes into Julia.
- 🤔 I’m looking for fun coding projects to spend my spare time on.
- 💬 Always up for a chat if you're interested!
- 📫 How to reach me: contact me through my <a href="https://emlynsg.com">personal website</a>.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him

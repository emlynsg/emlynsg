I'm Emlyn, a public servant and on-hiatus physicist, interested in too many things for one life! I like playing with data, and simulating physics and mathematics problems with code. I enjoy working in Python and R, and begrudgingly use C++ and Mathematica.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m working on my personal website, which has been very fun and quite confusing at the same time!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more R, and dipping my toes into Julia.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for a fun physics coding project to spend my socially distant weekends with.
- ðŸ’¬ Always up for a chat if you're interested!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @ me on <a href="https://twitter.com/emlynsg">Twitter</a> about anything!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him

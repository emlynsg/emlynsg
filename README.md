### Hi there 👋

I'm Emlyn, a physicist and nuclear specialist interested in quantum information and AI safety (among other things). I like playing with data, and simulating physics problems with code. I enjoy working in Python and R, learning Julia, playing in Mathematica, and will begrudgingly use C++ and Matlab if I have to.

- 🌱 I’m currently focusing on quickly learning at lot more about quantum information and AI safety.
- 🔭 I’m slowly working on my personal website, which has been very fun and a good learning experience too!
- 🤔 Interested in dabbling in self-hosting next.
- 💬 Always up for a chat if you're interested!
- 📫 How to reach me: contact me through my <a href="https://emlynsg.com">personal website</a>.
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him

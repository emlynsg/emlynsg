I'm Emlyn, a public servant and on-hiatus physicist, interested in too many things for one life! I like playing with data, and simulating physics and mathematics problems with code. I enjoy working in Python and R, and begrudgingly use C++ and Mathematica. I'm looking to get into blogging, and expanding my circle of online friends! 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my personal website, and flexing my design muscles in the process!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more R.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for a fun physics coding project.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about whatever you want! I probably don't know the answer!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: @ me on Twitter about anything!
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/him
